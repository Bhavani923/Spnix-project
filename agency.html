                Does your Brand need to have its own Podcast?
               </div>
               <p>
                A podcast is an audio file that can be downloaded and heard on the go, with episodes talking about a topic or overarching theme. </p>

            <p>To put it simply, it is a personal radio on your phone. </p>
<p>From its existence in 2004 to its popularity thanks to Adam Curry and Apple iTunes 4.9, podcasts have come a long way. Today, as per the Infinite Dial survey from Edison One and Triton Digital, 37% of Americans (above 12 years) listened to a minimum of one podcast every month in 2020. In 2019, this number was 32% of Americans. That is not all. The future of podcasting looks bright too. While an estimated 100 million people heard a podcast every month in 2020, it is expected to reach 125 million by 2022. </p>

                Are Instagram Reels the next big thing in Marketing?
               </div>
               <p>
                <h4>1. You can educate your audience</h4>
If there is an announcement you want to make, such as the launch of a new product or service, you should use Reels to spread your message.<br>
<h4>2. You can show your audience who you are</h4>
Reels enables you to be authentic and speak to users one on one.<br>
<h4>3. You can show them a more personal side</h4>
Since brands put a lot of thought into the aesthetics of their Instagram feed, they might not post behind-the-scenes content on Instagram. Content that gives users a sneak peek into their lives. <br>
<h4>4. You can establish yourself as an industry leader</h4>
Yes, this is possible even on Instagram. All you have to do is share knowledge about your domain or industry.<br>
<h4>5. You can showcase your products</h4>
That too, without being salesy. All you need to do is follow the latest trend. And subtly insert your product in it.

                Benefits of having a Chatbot for your Business
               </div>
               <p>
                A chatbot is a software application that conducts a conversation with you through text or text-to-speech. It does so instead of providing you direct contact with an agent. Chatbots are driven by AI, machine learning, natural-language processing, and automated rules.
               </p>
               <h4>1. Chatbots increase customer satisfaction</h4>
Today, customers do not like waiting for long before they get the information they are seeking.
<h4>2. Chatbots help generate insights</h4>
When the chatbot interacts with your customers, it gathers a lot of information about them.<br>
<h4>3. Chatbots help increase sales</h4>
As a business, one of your key goals is to drive sales.<br>
<h4>4. Chatbots save costs</h4>
Chatbots are a great way to meet all your organizational goals at an optimized cost. If you are operating without a chatbot, you need to hire customer service executives to look after customers’ needs.<br>
<h4>5.Chatbots enhance your service</h4>
Customer experience impacts the success of your business.

                What is Ad Tracking? How to Get Started With Ad Tracking
               </div>
               <p>
                Ad tracking is the process of keeping track of how much of an impact an advertising channel has. You can use ad tracking to track the return on investment for ad spending. Ad tracking also helps you to track exactly how effective your ad campaigns are and how much your ad spend translates to increased sales.</p>

            <p> You can glean countless granular data points with your digital advertising and customer data, making it easy to see how ad campaigns impact sales in almost real-time.</p>
                
            <p> While advertisers before the internet struggled with having almost no data to back up their new ad campaigns, modern digital advertisers have almost too much data. They must devote lots of time extracting the most valuable insights and trends from the plethora of data they gather. Ad tracking makes it easier for advertisers to measure their ads’ effectiveness, test new campaigns with minimal investment, and revise their ads more quickly in response to the data they gather from their tracking tools.
