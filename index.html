<h1>Our team of website experts will handle the entire development lifecycle of your project, from your website idea to the web development services needed to the publishing. Our website development cycle consists of the steps below:</h1>
<div class="mytabs">
  <input type="radio" id="tabfree" name="mytabs" checked="checked">
  <label for="tabfree">1. DISCOVERY   </label>
  <div class="tab">
    <h2>DISCOVERY </h2>
    <p>The first phase of a good web development project is Discovery. In short, it’s the process of learning. SPINX needs to learn as much as we can about you, your organization’s goals and users, and the required features and functionality of the site. With all this information in hand, we begin to lay the foundation for an optimal website. The Discovery phase will begin with information gathering. Conversations between our Project Management, User Experience and Development teams, and key stakeholders at your end, will further define the goals of the new website, determine the key user personas, and detail the desired functionality for the finished product.

    </p>Detailed insights for the discovery process will be further shared upon engagement.</p>
  </div>

  <input type="radio" id="tabsilver" name="mytabs">
  <label for="tabsilver">2. STRATEGIC ARCHITECTURE</label>
  <div class="tab">
    <h2>Strategic Architecture (User Experience & Information Architecture)</h2>
    <p>SPINX will use findings from the Discovery phase as the basis for strategy and suggestions for the site design. In this phase, we will make recommendations for the user experience and information architecture including a site map, core features and functionality, and how to display content in a way that is intuitive, engaging and achieves objectives.</p>

  <p>Detailed insights for the Strategic Architecture process will be further shared upon engagement.</p>
  </div>

  <input type="radio" id="tabgold" name="mytabs">
  <label for="tabgold">3. UI DESIGN</label>
  <div class="tab">
    <h2>Creative / UI Design</h2>
    <p>In the third phase, the creative process will begin with a couple designs for a home page. We find that basic restraints in terms of color or typography give us the freedom to be very creative with background elements, imagery, spacing between page elements, and animations to help determine the desired look and feel for the website. Once the home page has been approved and the overarching look of the site is locked in, we will then design the remaining pages required for the site.</p>

  <p> Detailed insights for the UI Design process will be further shared upon engagement.</p>
  </div>

  <input type="radio" id="tabd" name="mytabs">
  <label for="tabd">4. PROGRAMMING</label>
  <div class="tab">
    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>SPINX will mark-up the approved creatives to HTML 5, CSS, JQuery, Angular/ React, among with a suitable programming language and test all code in the latest version of designated browsers.</p>

      <p> Detailed insights for the Programming process will be further shared upon engagement.</p>
  </div>

  <input type="radio" id="tabg" name="mytabs">
  <label for="tabg">5. QUALITY CONTROL</label>
  <div class="tab">
    <h2>Accuracy Evaluation / Quality Control</h2>
    <p>Phase 5, one of the most critical steps, is where SPINX reviews all facets of the site prior to pushing it live. This includes review of all functionality and content. Reviewing all content to make sure all expectations have been met. modern tools for testing. After a thorough QA process, client is trained on the backend system and will have the opportunity to review and submit any bugs found during their QA process on a platform that is very easy to use tracking system.</p>

  <p>You will have complete insight into what bugs are being worked on, what are pending, which ones are ready to reviewed by your team and upon successful completion they can be moved into the completed bin.</p>

  <p> Detailed insights for the UI Design process will be further shared upon engagement.</p>
  </div>

  <input type="radio" id="tabo" name="mytabs">
  <label for="tabo">6. LAUNCH</label>
  <div class="tab">
    <h2>LAUNCH</h2>
    <p>With a launch plan in place, the final phase of the project is to launch the website publicly.</p>

  <p>  This includes reviewing all files and confirming one last time that all content is viewable, accurate and functional as it was on the development server.</p>

  <p> Detailed insights for the UI Design process will be further shared upon engagement.</p>

    <p>Since Bitcoin's initial release in 2009, digital currencies have piqued the interest of investors spanning from tech enthusiasts to institutional investors, however not all investors have the time or knowledge to track prices and conduct trades. TraderPlan developed a new and incredibly innovative way to allow traders of any skill level to be able to automate trades based on parameters they set and control, however they didn't have a website or any way to visually convey their offerings. All of their sales, marketing, and communication with prospective users was through Discord, a contemporary version of an online chat room.</p>
